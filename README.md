# Library Instruction Resources
I keep spinning up various things for use in library instruction and I want it to be easier for people to take the things I make.
So this is a gallery of things you can take- they were created with AI and their creation was iniated and shaped by me, Helena Marvin
and I am releasing these things as CC0 (public domain) objects folks are allowed to take, unless otherwise noted!
